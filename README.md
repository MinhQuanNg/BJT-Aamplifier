# BJT-Aamplifier
Designed and simulated a 3-stage inverting BJT amplifier (CC-CE-CC) meeting all design specifications, including a +10V power supply and a total quiescent current of 5.58mA, well within the 10mA limit. Conducted comprehensive AC and DC analysis to achieve a no-load voltage gain of 50 ±10% and a maximum loaded output voltage of 4V peak-to-peak under a 1kΩ load, ensuring reliable performance. The circuit demonstrated a frequency response from 20Hz to 50kHz (-3dB) and maintained an input resistance above 20kΩ. Documented all calculations, analysis, and benchmarks in a detailed design report, achieving a distortion-free output within specified limits.
